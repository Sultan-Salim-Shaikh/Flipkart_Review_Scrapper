Slightly disappointed,"Everything in this mobile is pretty good and android is lovely. A very bad experience from samsung. Network problem is really unacceptable. In the area where network is very high in this area it is saying out of network coverage area. At all, not happy with the performance of the mobile. I was very excited bcoz this was my 1st ever samsung mobile till now.READ MORE",Aloka Sahu,2
